Design patterns are reusable, agnostic, solutions to commonly occurring problems within a given context in information design.

Where an existing problem has been solved in other domains, design patterns use logical modelling to represent the solution in a way that abstracts the physical architecture and operational rules leaving only the formal logic that must be followed in order to achieve the same solution.

The NHS Wales FHIR standards make use of patterns agreed within Wales as well as with wider groups of stakeholders, taking advantage of best practice and supporting interoperability more widely.

When implemented in FHIR, these design patterns may be expressed as Resources. For more information on use of patterns within FHIR by HL7 International, see https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patterns.html
