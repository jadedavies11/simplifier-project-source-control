The Data Standards Wales FHIR Implementation Guide, including this website and the associated package of FHIR Resources, is intended to provide guidance for the implementation of interoperable standards for data in systems, platforms, and services in health and social care for Wales.

Where a specific system, platform, or service implements these basic standards there will invariably be an additional layer of proscriptive constraints and assumptions to reflect business logic and functional requirements.

This implementation remains agnostic to those more specific use cases and cannot be assumed to reflect each of them completely. As an implementer of Data Standards Wales FHIR resources, it is your responsibility to account for the systems, platforms, or services that you intend to interact with to ensure interoperability.
