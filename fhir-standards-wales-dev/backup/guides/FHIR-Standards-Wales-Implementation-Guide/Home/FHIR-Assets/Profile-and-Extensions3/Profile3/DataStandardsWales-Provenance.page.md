### Overview
The [Provenance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/provenance.html) resource tracks information about the activity that created, revised, deleted, or signed a version of a resource, describing the entities and agents involved.

The {{page-title}} profile is derived from the [HL7 R4 Provenance](http://hl7.org/fhir/Provenance.html). It defines additional rules for use within health and care organisations in Wales.

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
Refer to the {{pagelink:Mandatory-and-Must-Support-Data-Elements,text: Mandatory and Must Support}} page for guidance on how these elements should be interpreted.
 
Each Provenance must have:
* One or more targets
* A recorded timestamp
* One or more agents

Each Provenance must support:
* One or more entities if relevant

### Implementation Guidance 
The `Provenance.agent` field **SHOULD** include all agents involved in the activity. Typical agents include
* Devices such as software systems or components
* Clinical devices 
* Human users

The `Provenance.entity` field **MAY** be used to indicate one or more entities in this activity, and may be used to refer, for example, to an HL7v2 message used to update demographic information within a Patient resource. 

The `Provenance.recorded` field **SHALL** be include a timestamp to indicate when the activity was recorded/updated.


The `Provenance.target` field **SHALL** be populated to reference the FHIR resource(s) that were generated or updated by the activity described in this resource. A provenance can point to more than one target if multiple resources were created/updated by the same activity.

Please see the {{pagelink:Home/Guidance/Provenance}} page within the Guidance section for further information. 

### Extensions 
Some use cases require the original demographic data at time of recording to stored directly against the clinical data e.g. for diagnostic reports in Wales. This additional provenace can be captured using the {{pagelink:Extension-DataStandardsWales-DemographicsAsRecorded,text:DataStandardsWales-DemographicsAsRecorded}} extension.
