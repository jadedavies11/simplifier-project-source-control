## {{page-title}}

The [Immunization](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/immunization.html) resource is a record of the immunization received by a patient, often in the form of a vaccine.

The {{page-title}} profile is derived from the [UK Core Immunization Profile](https://simplifier.net/guide/UK-Core-Implementation-Guide-STU2/Home/ProfilesandExtensions/Profile-UKCore-Immunization?version=2.0.1). It defines additional rules for use within health and care organisations in Wales.
