### Overview
The [Encounter-UEC](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/encounter.html) resource is used to describe a patient’s attendance at a healthcare facility for Urgent and Emergency Care.

The {{page-title}} profile is derived from the {{page-title}} profile is derived from the {{pagelink:DataStandardsWales-Encounter, text: NHS Wales Encounter Profile}} and is therefore listed as experimental. It defines additional rules for use within Urgent and Emergency Care uses in health and care organisations in Wales.

Refer to [Digital Health and Care Wales Welsh Emergency Care Data Set User Guide v0.1](https://dhcw.nhs.wales/data/information-standards/data-standards/data-standards-files/20250123-wecds-user-guide-v1-00-final-published-pdf/) for additional guidance.
