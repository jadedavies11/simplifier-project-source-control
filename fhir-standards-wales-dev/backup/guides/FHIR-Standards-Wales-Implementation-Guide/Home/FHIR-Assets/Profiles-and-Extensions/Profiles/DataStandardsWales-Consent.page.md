## {{page-title}}
The [Consent](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/consent.html) profile is to be used to express a Consent regarding Healthcare. There are four anticipated uses for the Consent Resource, all of which are written or verbal agreements by a healthcare consumer (grantor) or a personal representative, made to an authorised entity (grantee) concerning authorised or restricted actions with any limitations on purpose of use, and handling instructions to which the authorised entity SHALL comply:
* Privacy Consent Directive: Agreement to collect, access, use or disclose (share) information.
* Medical Treatment Consent Directive: Consent to undergo a specific treatment (or record of refusal to consent).
* Research Consent Directive: Consent to participate in research protocol and information sharing required.
* Advance Care Directives: Consent to instructions for potentially needed medical treatment (e.g. DNR).
 
The {{page-title}} profile is derived from the [HL7 R4 Consent](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/consent.html). It defines additional rules for use within health and care organisations in Wales.
