Provenance data MUST be recorded for all FHIR resources that are stored within the Care Data Repository within the National Data Resource. As a minimum, details of the contributing system must be recorded as part of the Provenance data. All systems writing data via FHIR API calls are responsible for recording this data correctly.


This is required in order to maintain traceability of data, and to facilitate the management of data that may have originated from many different sources.
