The UK Core Access implementation guide can be found at the following link:

[UK Core Access](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7-UK/UK-Core-Access/index.html)

It is currently under development and has yet to have a major release.

The intention of this guide is to provide standardisation of UK Core FHIR API RESTful endpoints so that clinical data queries are valid across multiple implementations.  This will allow greater interoperability across systems and a standard method for suppliers to interact with clinical data stores.  It is recommended that any data store implementation follows the search parameters published on this page.
