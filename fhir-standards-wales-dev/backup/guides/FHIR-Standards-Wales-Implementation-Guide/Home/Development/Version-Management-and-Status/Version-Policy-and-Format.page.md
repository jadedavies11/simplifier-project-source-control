The versioning for Wales FHIR Standards assets is based on the [Semantic Versioning Standard](https://semver.org/). The version is identified by a string composed from 4 parts: 

Major.Minor.Patch-Label

* Major – a significant release which includes breaking changes. For example, addition of new mandatory element(s) in a profile
* Minor – an update that includes minor substantive changes. These changes are not expected to break existing implementations. For example, addition of new optional elements in a profile
* Patch – an update that only includes compatible technical corrections, non-substantive (editorial) changes or clarifications that do not invalidate a reasonable interpretation of the previously documented use of an asset. E.g. correcting typos in the short description of an element in a FHIR profile
* Label – a tag at the end of a release representing a 'working' version of the specification that is building up to the specified release number, consequently this may not always be exposed. E.g. -rc OR - release candidate, -experimental, -ballot

Additional examples which illustrate the above categories are provided in {{pagelink:Change-Types}}
