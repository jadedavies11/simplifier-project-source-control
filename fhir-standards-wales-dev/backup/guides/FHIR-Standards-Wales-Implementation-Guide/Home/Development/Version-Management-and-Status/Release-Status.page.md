Standards for Trial Use (STU) – Used to describe releases, the STU is usually suffixed with a number to denote the current version (e.g. STU1, STU2, etc.) and the number will increase after every ballot.

The STU release is relatively stable because it has been though the Wales FHIR Standards Development Process and, depending on the type of changes, may have culminated in the Wales FHIR Ballot Process. 

Note that HL7 FHIR and HL7 FHIR UK Core, both have their own STU numbering. These and our own releases, therefore, have three separate STU numbering sequences that are not interchangeable.
