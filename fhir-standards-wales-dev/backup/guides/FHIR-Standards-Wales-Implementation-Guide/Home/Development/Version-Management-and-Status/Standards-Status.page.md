Alongside version numbering, the Wales FHIR Implementation Guide employs status categories based on HL7 FHIR terminology. These are categorical terms used to denote the stability and risk of an asset.

The above diagram illustrates how the development of a Wales FIR asset typically progresses and can be summarised as:

* Starting as **Draft** which provides insight into future versions and is a place-holder for feedback
* Moves to **Trial Use** for real-world testing
* Becomes **Normative** when stable and locked for backward compatibility
* Eventually may be **Deprecated** when retired
