### Release Strategy

We have recently moved from Discovery phase to a Standard for Trial Use 1 (STU1) for ballot as part of our release strategy.  The profiles in DRAFT have had a first pass review by our Interoperability Task & Finish Group to integrate coding standards and Value Sets as dictated by Data Standards Wales.

1. Discovery phase - completed
2. v0.1.0 STU1 (and onwards) for ballot - current phase (26/05/2023 onwards)
3. v1.0.0 STU1 for pre-release
4. v1.0.0 STU1 for implementation

This release strategy follows the [UK Core Publication History](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreversionhistory?version=current).

### Balloting

Following the first STU1 for ballot release,  we will develop a review strategy to obtain feedback on profiles. This will be circulated in due course.
