A Data Standards Change Notice (DSCN) is a mandate to NHS and partner organisations and system suppliers to ensure they can support a new or changed data standard.

A Data Dictionary Change Notice (DDCN) is a notification outlining any changes to the NHS Wales Data Dictionary that do not introduce new or changed information requirements.

Relationships exist between the Wales FHIR Implementation Guide and Change Notices, either because a Change Notice mandates the use of specific Profiles within the Guide or because the Guide uses Value Sets that are included within existing Change Notices.  

A summary of the Change Notices used within this Guide are listed in the table below. Refer to <b> Content </b> for information on how these are used within Profiles or Value Sets.
