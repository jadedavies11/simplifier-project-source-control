### Overview
The [Encounter](https://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html) resource is used to describe a patient’s attendance at a healthcare facility. Encounters can take place in many forms, such as:
* An emergency or scheduled hospital admission
* An outpatient consultation
* A visit to the GP, or virtual attendance via video link
* Attendance at a mobile breast cancer screening clinic
* Attendance at a mass vaccination centre to receive a vaccination
* A visit from a health care professional to the patient’s home

The {{page-title}} profile is derived from the [UK Core STU2 Encounter Profile](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu2/Home/ProfilesandExtensions/Profile-UKCore-Encounter?version=current) and is therefore listed as experimental. It defines additional rules for use within health and care organisations in Wales.
