The following Naming Systems are published within this guide for use within Wales.  For more information please see [UK Naming Systems.](https://simplifier.net/guide/uknamingsystems?version=current)

Data Standards Wales is responsible for the creation of namespaces and OIDs for NHS Wales systems. If you require one to be created please contact them using the email on the {{pagelink:Home/Help-and-Support/Help-and-Support.page.md,text:help and support}} page and ask for the link to the request form (internal to NHS Wales).

There are a few hundred systems currently registered with OIDs but it has been decided we will not add them all as naming systems as standard procedure. To be pragmatic we have added the most used, high-level system identifiers. If you require a naming system adding please contact data standards but please remember that identifiers are extensible so you are not limited to the below namespaces.
