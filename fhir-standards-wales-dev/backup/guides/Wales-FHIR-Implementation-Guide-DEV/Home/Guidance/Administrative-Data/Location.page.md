The {{pagelink:DataStandardsWales-Location, text: Location}} resource contains information about a physical space where care is provided such as a room, ward or clinic, vaccination centre or pharmacy. It can also describe any location where resources and participants may be found, contained, or accommodated, such as a cupboard, locker or storeroom. Location resources contain detail about address and location, times of operation.
