This Implementation Guide defines interoperability standards for Health and Care organisations in Wales through the use of FHIR. 

These standards are derived from the [UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core) which defines an approach to interoperability using FHIR across the four UK nations. This guide provides additional documentation to support and clarify the usage of FHIR in Wales.

Readers will require at least a basic level of knowledge about HL7 FHIR. 
* The formal specification of the standard is available [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html). 
* [Introduction to FHIR by INTEROP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT17_5ROp3Q) video which provides a useful presentation to FHIR.
