### Dependenacies

The NHS Wales FHIR Implementation guide currently has the following package dependencies:

* [UK Core STU1 v1.0.0](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/1.0.0)
* [HL7 FHIR R4 v4.0.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r4.core/4.0.1)

Please ensure that you have downloaded these dependencies when implementing the NHS Wales FHIR profiles into your system.

#### Firely Terminal

The Firely Terminal includes all necessary packages for your system implementation but requires a Firely licence to use commercially.  This can, however, be used for testing purposes.

#### NPM

Ensure that you download each package individually so that all asset dependencies are available.
