## {{page-title}}
This guide contains two different types of resource references:

* Contents: A set of logical statements which implementations must conform to. These are almost always [conformance resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-module.html). These are published in the FHIR Assets section.
* Examples: Examples that illustrate the intent of the profiles defined in the implementation guide. These can be any kind of resource.
