This Implementation Guide defines draft discovery interoperability standards for Welsh Results and reporting service FHIR data. 

These standards are derived from the [UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core) which defines an approach to interoperability using FHIR across the four UK nations. This this guide provides addition documentation to support and clarify the usage of FHIR in Wales.

Readers will require at least a basic level of knowledge about HL7 FHIR. 
* The formal specification of the standard is available [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html). 
* This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT17_5ROp3Q) provides a useful introduction to FHIR.
