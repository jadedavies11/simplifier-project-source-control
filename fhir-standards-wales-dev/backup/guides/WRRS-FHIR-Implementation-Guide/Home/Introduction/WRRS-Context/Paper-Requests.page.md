Paper requests are exactly what you would expect. A request, made on a paper form, to be carried around by the patient and handed in to whatever receptionist who can process the request. Not efficient and not traceable.
These paper requests will cause an electronic result from the laboratory and radiology systems.
Key data from an electronic request would be the placer of the request and the date and time of the request. Other useful data would be the specimen and container information. This data is lost by the time it gets to the laboratory systems.
For he purpose of FHIR, the ability to correctly populate a resource becomes overly challenging.
