A Data Standards Change Notice (DSCN) is a mandate to NHS and partner organisations and system suppliers to ensure they can support a new or changed data standard.

A Data Dictionary Change Notice (DDCN) is a notification outlining any changes to the NHS Wales Data Dictionary that do not introduce new or changed information requirements.

<b>Please also refer to the {{pagelink:Home/Welsh-Health-Circulars.page.md}} page to see relevant guidance issued by Welsh Government.</b>

Relationships exist between the Wales FHIR Implementation Guide and Change Notices, either because a Change Notice mandates the use of specific Profiles within the Guide or because the Guide uses Value Sets that are included within existing Change Notices.  

A summary of the Change Notices used within this Guide are listed in the table below. Refer to <b> Content </b> for information on how these are used within Profiles or Value Sets.
