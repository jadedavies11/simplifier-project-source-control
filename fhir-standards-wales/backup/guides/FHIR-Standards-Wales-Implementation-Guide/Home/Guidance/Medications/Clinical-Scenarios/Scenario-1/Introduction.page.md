# Clinical scenario for examples of Medication List and Medication Statement

In this scenario, a patient is admitted as an inpatient; most of their regular medicines are continued however one is stopped because of an adverse reaction. FHIR examples show the patient’s medications could be expressed in FHIR at each step of the journey from before admission through to discharge, using a Medication List i.e. a FHIR List of MedicationStatement resources. The detailed content of the example MedicationStatement resources illustrate how information about medications is expected to change in the data from step to step of the patient’s journey.  

The purpose of these examples is to illustrate FHIR usage based on a simple clinical scenario.
