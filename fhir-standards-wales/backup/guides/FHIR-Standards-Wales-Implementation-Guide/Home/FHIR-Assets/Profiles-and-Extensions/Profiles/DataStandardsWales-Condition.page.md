### Overview
The [Condition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition.html) resource describes a clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern. 

The {{page-title}} 
profile is derived from the [UK Core Condition Profile](https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide-stu2/Home/ProfilesandExtensions/Profile-UKCore-Condition). It defines additional rules for use within health and care organisations in Wales.
